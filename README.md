🌐 ##NavSecure – AI-Powered Safe Navigation App

“Because the safest route matters more than the fastest.”

NavSecure is an AI-powered smart navigation app designed to prioritize safety over speed. Unlike traditional map applications that only focus on the fastest route, NavSecure analyzes real-time and historical data — including street lighting, CCTV coverage, crime hotspots, and crowdsourced safety reports — to recommend the safest path possible.

It also features a one-tap SOS emergency system, quick access to safe spots, and community-driven safety reporting, making commuting safer for women, students, late-shift employees, solo travelers, and everyone who values safety.
